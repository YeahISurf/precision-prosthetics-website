## Issues Addressed During Development

1. **Header Overlap**: Fixed issue where the fixed header was overlapping page content by creating a PageContainer component that automatically adds padding based on header height.

2. **Image Consistency**: Standardized all images to consistent dimensions (800x500) to maintain grid layouts and prevent distortion. Added image containers with fixed heights and object-fit properties.

3. **Responsive Layouts**: Ensured all page layouts work properly across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using Chakra UI's responsive array syntax.

4. **Navigation Behavior**: Implemented ScrollToTop component to ensure pages scroll to the top when navigating between routes.

5. **Card Heights**: Fixed inconsistent card heights in grid layouts by implementing flex containers and auto-margin spacing.

6. **Form Validation**: Implemented comprehensive form validation with proper error displays and user feedback.

7. **Content Visibility**: Ensured proper contrast for text readability by adding appropriate overlays to background images.

8. **Build Configuration**: Added ESLint configuration and environment settings to prevent warnings from failing builds.

## Development Notes from Claude Chat

This project was developed through an iterative collaboration with Claude AI. The development process included:

1. **Initial Setup**: Created GitHub repository structure and initial React application with routing.

2. **Component Development**: Built core components and pages based on the technical requirements.

3. **Premium Enhancements**: Added sophisticated design elements, animations, and improved UI components.

4. **Bug Fixing**: Addressed various layout, styling, and functionality issues.

5. **Deployment Optimization**: Fixed build errors and implemented configuration for successful Vercel deployment.

The chat progressed through several iterations to enhance the website's premium feel, fix various UI issues, and ensure proper deployment.

## Next Steps

1. **Content Enhancement**: Replace placeholder content with more detailed and relevant content.

2. **Backend Integration**: Implement actual backend services for form handling and data management.

3. **SEO Optimization**: Add meta tags, structured data, and improve page load performance.

4. **Analytics Integration**: Add tracking and analytics for user behavior insights.

5. **Additional Features**: Consider adding a patient portal, appointment scheduling system, or insurance verification tool.

## Notes for Future Claude Sessions

If you're continuing this project in a new Claude session, here are the key points to understand:

1. The project is a premium website for a prosthetics company built with React and Chakra UI.

2. We've implemented a custom design system in theme.js that defines colors, typography, and component variants.

3. The site structure includes multiple pages with consistent styling and premium UI components.

4. We've created several reusable components that follow a consistent design language.

5. Forms use Formik and Yup for validation, with EmailJS for submission handling.

6. All images are standardized to 800x500 dimensions for consistency in card layouts.

7. The site is deployed via Vercel with specific build configuration to handle ESLint warnings.

8. The website is meant to convey a premium, trustworthy impression for a medical services company.

Context from our previous conversations includes iteratively improving the premium feel of the site, addressing various styling issues, fixing image quality and consistency problems, and resolving deployment errors.
