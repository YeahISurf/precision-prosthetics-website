        question: 'How long does it take to get a prosthetic limb?',
        answer: 'The fabrication of a prosthesis is a very labor-intensive process that requires multiple fittings to ensure the best fit. Once insurance authorization is obtained, it typically takes about 2-4 weeks to create a custom prosthetic device.

        question: 'How long will my prosthetic limb last?',
        answer: 'The lifespan of a prosthetic device depends on several factors, including your activity level, body changes, and how well the device is maintained. On average, a prosthetic limb may last between 3-5 years. However, components may need to be replaced or adjusted more frequently. Regular check-ups with our prosthetists will help ensure your device remains in optimal condition.',

        question: 'Will I be able to do the same activities I did before my amputation?',

Our team works with you to understand your goals and design a prosthetic solution that supports your desired activity level. We also provide training and rehabilitation support to help you adapt to your prosthetic and regain confidence in your abilities.',

        question: 'How do I know which type of prosthetic is right for me?',

During your consultation, our prosthetists will discuss these factors with you and recommend options that best meet your needs. We may also consider your lifestyle, work requirements, and personal preferences to ensure your prosthetic device supports your quality of life.',
